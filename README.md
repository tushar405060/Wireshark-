video of network analyzing using wireshark filters
Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer used for capturing and analyzing network traffic in real time. It helps with troubleshooting network issues, security analysis, and understanding network protocols.

Key Features of Wireshark:
Packet Capture: Captures live network traffic or reads previously captured packets.

Protocol Analysis: Supports hundreds of network protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and more.

Filtering & Searching: Use display and capture filters (e.g., http, tcp.port == 80, etc.) to focus on relevant data.

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): View detailed packet information, including headers and payload.

Decryption Support: Can decrypt certain encrypted traffic (like TLS/SSL) if keys are available.

Live & Offline Analysis: Analyze packets in real-time or open saved capture files (.pcap, .pcapng).

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Common Use Cases:
Penetration Testing & Security Analysis: Identify vulnerabilities, sniff passwords (if unencrypted), and analyze attack patterns.

Network Troubleshooting: Diagnose slow network issues, dropped packets, and connectivity problems.

Reverse Engineering: Inspect network traffic for API interactions and malware analysis.

Learning Network Protocols: Study how different network protocols work.

How to Install Wireshark on Windows, Linux, and macOS
1. Install Wireshark on Windows
Steps:

Download the latest Wireshark setup from the official website:
ðŸ‘‰ https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Run the installer (.exe file) and follow the setup wizard.

During installation, select Npcap (necessary for live packet capture).

Complete the installation and launch Wireshark.

âœ… To capture packets on a network interface, run Wireshark as Administrator.

Here are 20 useful Wireshark filters categorized by their purpose which are used in this video:

1. Basic IP Filtering:
ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 â†’ Show traffic involving a specific IP.

ip.src == 192.168.1.1 â†’ Show traffic originating from a specific IP.

ip.dst == 192.168.1.1 â†’ Show traffic destined for a specific IP.

ip.addr == 192.168.1.1 && ip.addr == 192.168.1.2 â†’ Show traffic between two specific IPs.

2. Protocol-Based Filtering:
tcp â†’ Show only TCP packets.

udp â†’ Show only UDP packets.

icmp â†’ Show only ICMP packets (useful for analyzing pings).

arp â†’ Show only ARP packets (useful for detecting ARP spoofing).

3. Port-Based Filtering:
tcp.port == 80 â†’ Show only HTTP traffic.

tcp.port == 443 â†’ Show only HTTPS traffic.

udp.port == 53 â†’ Show only DNS traffic.

tcp.port == 21 â†’ Show only FTP traffic.

tcp.port == 22 â†’ Show only SSH traffic.

4. Payload and Data Filtering:
http.request.method == "GET" â†’ Show only HTTP GET requests.

http contains "password" â†’ Show packets containing the word "password" in HTTP requests.

dns.qry.name contains "example.com" â†’ Show only DNS queries for "example.com".

tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0 â†’ Show only TCP SYN packets (useful for detecting SYN scans).

5. Advanced Security and Attack Detection:
eth.src == aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff â†’ Show packets from a specific MAC address.

ip.ttl < 10 â†’ Show packets with a low TTL (potential sign of a traceroute or attack).

tcp.analysis.retransmission â†’ Show only retransmitted TCP packets (useful for diagnosing network issues).
